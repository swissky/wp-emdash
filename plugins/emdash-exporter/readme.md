Export your WordPress content to EmDash CMS via REST API. Full support for posts, pages, custom post types, ACF fields, media, and SEO data.

## Description

EmDash Exporter adds REST API endpoints to your WordPress site that allow EmDash CMS to import your content directly—no file downloads required.

**Features:**

- **One-click import** – Connect EmDash to your site and import everything
- **Full content** – Posts, pages, and custom post types including drafts
- **Media with metadata** – Images, videos, and files with alt text, captions, and dimensions
- **Custom fields** – Full ACF support plus any custom meta fields
- **SEO data** – Yoast SEO and Rank Math meta automatically included
- **Taxonomies** – Categories, tags, and custom taxonomies with hierarchy
- **Authors** – User data for proper attribution

## Authentication

Uses WordPress Application Passwords (built into WordPress 5.6+). Create an application password in your user profile, then use it with your WordPress username to authenticate API requests.

## Installation

1. Upload the `emdash-exporter` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create an Application Password: Users → Your Profile → Application Passwords
4. In EmDash, enter your site URL and credentials to begin import

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are under `/wp-json/emdash/v1/`

### Public (no auth required):

- `GET /probe` – Site info and capabilities

### Authenticated:

- `GET /analyze` – Full site analysis for import planning
- `GET /content?post_type=post` – Get posts (paginated)
- `GET /media` – Get media items (paginated)
- `GET /media/{id}?include_data=true` – Get single media item with base64 data
- `GET /taxonomies` – Get all taxonomies and terms
- `GET /options` – Get site options

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to install anything on my EmDash site? =

> No. This plugin runs on your WordPress site and exposes an API that EmDash connects to.

### Is my content secure?

> Yes. All export endpoints (except /probe) require authentication. Use Application Passwords and HTTPS.

### What about my media files?

> Media URLs are included in the export. EmDash downloads them directly from your WordPress site during import. Optionally, small files can be transferred inline as base64.

### Does this work with custom post types?

> Yes! All public post types are automatically included, along with their custom fields.

### What about ACF fields?

> Full ACF support. Field groups are analyzed, and field values are exported with proper type information.
